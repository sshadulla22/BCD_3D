# 3D and 4D Image Visualization
## BCD PROJECT - 03

This Streamlit app allows you to upload an image (in grayscale format) and visualize it in 3D and 4D. You can preprocess the image at different levels, view various 3D visualizations, and adjust settings such as opacity for better interactivity.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: View the image with different levels of preprocessing such as Gaussian blur, sharpening, and contrast adjustments.
- **3D Visualization**: Display the image in a 3D surface plot, contour plot, and wireframe plot.
- **Interactive 3D Volume**: Explore the 3D volume of the image with interactive rotation.
- **Adjustable Opacity**: Modify the opacity of the 3D volume for better visualization.
- **4D Visualization**: Simulate a time series (4D) by stacking the image over multiple frames.
- **Image Download**: Download the original processed image.

## Instructions
1. **Upload Image**: Upload a grayscale image (JPG, PNG, JPEG) to visualize it in 3D and 4D.
2. **Preprocessing Levels**: View different preprocessing levels side-by-side (e.g., Gaussian blur, sharpening, contrast enhancement).
3. **3D Visualizations**: Click buttons to view various 3D visualizations (surface plot, contour plot, wireframe plot).
4. **Adjust Opacity**: Use the slider to adjust the opacity of the 3D volume for better visibility.
5. **4D Visualization**: Simulate a time series of the image in 4D.
6. **Download Image**: Download the processed image after applying preprocessing.
